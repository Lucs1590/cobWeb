[![Python Package using Conda](https://github.com/Lucs1590/CobWeb/actions/workflows/python-package-conda.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Lucs1590/CobWeb/actions/workflows/python-package-conda.yml)

This is a work carried out for the collection of climatic data, as well as data on bugs and diseases that affect crops in agriculture.

## Motivation
This was a work that began at the São Paulo State Faculty of Technology with the big data course in agribusiness. The challenge was for the students to be able to create a script for the collection of data that directly interfered with the yield of agricultural production so that these data would bring value in the future.
The work was carried out by students [Lucas de Brito Silva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-brito100/), [Samuel Licorio Leiva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-licorio-leiva-668535137/) and [Vinicios de Paula Alves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vin%C3%ADciudpalves/).
